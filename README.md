# MERN-stack Weather App
React Weather App is a responsive web application that allows users to:

- Search for real-time weather conditions by city.
- View detailed forecasts for multiple days.
- Manage weather records with full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Interact with a clean, user-friendly interface.

This app uses OpenWeather API for weather data and GeoDB Cities API for city suggestions. It is built with React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data persistence.
